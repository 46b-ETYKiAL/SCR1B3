"""Fail if a release artifact could ever ship without its license texts.

SCR1B3 `include_bytes!`-embeds 22 third-party typefaces directly into the
shipped executable (21 SIL Open Font License 1.1, plus Syncopate under
Apache-2.0) and `include_str!`-embeds a third-party English word list as the
built-in spell-check dictionary. OFL-1.1 section 2 requires the license text to
accompany EVERY copy of the Font Software, including when it is bundled inside
a larger program.

Before this gate existed the primary release `.tar.gz` contained ONLY the
binary -- not even LICENSE-MIT -- and the .deb, .AppImage and .dmg carried no
license text either. That is a license breach on distribution, and nothing in
CI would ever have noticed it.

This checker asserts over the packaging MANIFEST (workflow + build scripts) and
the repo tree -- it does NOT build artifacts, so it is fast and runnable on any
platform. Four independent checks:

  1. Every bundled font directory carries a license file.
  2. `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` documents every bundled font AND the
     `include_str!`-embedded word list.
  3. Every artifact-producing step in `.github/workflows/release.yml` invokes
     the license collector.
  4. Every local packaging build script invokes the license collector.

Check 3 is the one that stops silent regression: if someone rewrites a
packaging step and drops the collector call, this fails.

Usage:
    python packaging/verify_license_delivery.py [--repo-root PATH]

Exit 0 = every artifact path delivers licenses. Exit 1 = a breach is possible.

# "Package + checksum", because the word "checksum" appears in its name. The

# gate reported OK. Matching on a step's NAME to decide whether it produces an
# artifact is the bug; matching on what the step RUNS is the fix.
