//! Phase 15 KEYSTONE — `Buffer` enum: mmap-browse for large files, rope for
//! edits, with first-edit promotion that converts a read-only mmap into a
//! mutable rope without ever touching the on-disk file.
//!
//! ## Why a new abstraction next to `Document`
//!
//! [`Document`] (in `document.rs`) ALREADY mmap-browses files above the
//! 256 MiB threshold, but **immediately copies** the mmap'd bytes into a
//! `Rope`. That defeats the multi-GB browse target (a 4 GiB log file would
//! cost a 4 GiB rope at open time). The rope-editor KEYSTONE design
//! requires a buffer that **stays in the mmap representation until the
//! first edit** so a multi-GB read-only browse session keeps RSS bounded.
//!
//! `Buffer` is the new abstraction. The widget consumes `&mut Buffer` and
//! triggers [`Buffer::promote_to_rope`] when the user types. The
//! `Document` integration is a follow-up — for now the two abstractions
//! coexist and the widget operates on `Buffer` directly.
//!
//! ## Variants
//!
//! - [`Buffer::Mmap`]  — read-only memory-mapped file. Holds the live
//!   `memmap2::Mmap` handle + a lazily-built line index (offset to each
//!   `\n`). Indexing is `O(log n)` after the index is built.
//! - [`Buffer::Rope`]  — owned, mutable rope (the ropey 1.6 implementation).
//!   Created from scratch, from a small file, or from an mmap promoted at
//!   first edit.
//!
//! ## Promotion path
//!
//! [`Buffer::promote_to_rope`] decodes the mmap through `crate::encoding`
//! (BOM sniff + chardetng statistical detection, lossy only on malformed
//! sequences — matches the existing `Document::open` discipline) and moves
//! the resulting string into a fresh `Rope::from_str`. The mmap handle is
//! dropped. The on-disk file is never touched.
//!
//! ## Why not put this on `Document`
//!
//! `Document` carries encoding + EOL + dirty state already. Adding the
//! mmap-then-promote dance to `Document` widens its API surface for a
//! feature only the rope-editor widget needs. The KEYSTONE design keeps
//! `Buffer` as the lower-layer storage; the rope-editor widget owns it;
//! follow-ups may unify the two when the multi-GB browse path lands in
//! production.
