//! Cursor + selection + edit primitives over a [`ropey::Rope`].
//!
//! This is the editing model the owned rope editor (KEYSTONE) is built on —
//! the layer egui's `TextEdit` provides internally and which we must own to
//! get multi-cursor, a real persistent undo stack, and viewport-culled
//! editing on a multi-GiB buffer.
//!
//! It is deliberately **UI-free and pure**: every operation is a function over
//! `(&mut Rope, &mut EditState)`, so the whole model is unit-testable without
//! an egui context. Indices are CHAR indices (ropey's native unit), never
//! bytes, so multi-byte UTF-8 never splits a caret.
