//! Network half of the in-app self-updater.
//!
//! Telemetry-free by construction: the only network surfaces are
//! 1. a single unauthenticated `GET` of the public GitHub Releases API,
//! 2. download of the SIGNED `latest.json` manifest + its `.minisig`, and
//! 3. downloads of the release archive + its `.minisig` + `.sha256` siblings.
//!
//! No analytics, no identifiers, no payload: every request sends only a generic
//! `User-Agent` (app name + version). A Tier-1 client installs ONLY through the
//! verified signed manifest — the archive is verified (its bytes pinned to the
//! manifest's SIGNED SHA-256, then minisign against
//! [`super::verify::EMBEDDED_PUBLIC_KEYS`]) before the extracted binary is ever
//! returned. A verify failure deletes the staging area and the binary is NEVER
//! returned unverified. **There is no install path that skips the manifest.**
//!
//! ## Tier-1 REQUIRES a verified manifest — fail-CLOSED, no fallback
//!
//! When a newer release is discovered, this client REQUIRES that release to
//! carry a signed `latest.json` (+ `latest.json.minisig`). If the manifest is
//! ABSENT or fails verification, the update is REFUSED — there is deliberately
//! NO fallback to a legacy per-asset selector. A fallback would make the
//! freeze-beacon, the `minimum_version` floor, and the signed-hash binding
//! OPTIONAL: an attacker who strips `latest.json` (or its `.minisig`) could
//! force the weaker path and downgrade the protection. The legacy non-manifest
//! selectors (`select_best` / `select_update` / `build_release_info`) were
//! REMOVED for exactly this reason — they no longer exist as a code path.
//!
//! Pure decision logic ([`resolve_tier1_update`]) is split out from the I/O so
//! it can be unit-tested offline against a fixture [`RawRelease`] + manifest.
//!
//! ## Asset naming
//!
//! SCR1B3's release workflow publishes, per target, an archive named
//! `scr1b3-<target>.tar.gz` plus a `.sha256` and a `.minisig` sidecar, and
//! (Windows) a self-elevating `scr1b3-<tag>-x86_64-setup.exe` installer with its
//! own sidecars. [`manifest::Manifest::archive_for`] matches the in-place
//! archive by the **target-triple substring + `.tar.gz` extension**;
//! [`manifest::Manifest::installer_for`] matches the elevated installer.
