//! `"arrowup"`). This module is the other half: it binds that token to an
//! [`egui::Key`] and answers "did the user press the chord bound to <action>
//! this frame?".
//!
//! Modifier matching is EXACT — a chord bound to `mod+o` does not fire when Shift
//! is also held. That is what keeps `mod+o` (open file) and `mod+shift+o` (go to
//! symbol) distinct without the hand-written `!i.modifiers.shift` guards the
//! hard-wired handler used to need.

    // key — so `i.key_pressed(c.key)` is always false, which short-circuits the

    // exercised the Plus-tolerance arm. The shape that discriminates is the
    // opposite: press the RIGHT key with the WRONG modifiers, so `mods_ok` is
    // the term that has to decide.

    // `find` is `mod+f` and `find_in_files` is `mod+shift+f` — they differ by
    // exactly one modifier, so a `mods_ok` that stops being exact collapses the
    // two chords into one.
