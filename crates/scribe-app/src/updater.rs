//! In-app self-updater UI orchestration.
//!
//! The network discovery, signature/checksum verification, archive extraction,
//! and binary swap all live in `scribe_core::update` (and are unit-tested
//! there). This module owns only the egui-thread-friendly orchestration: each
//! operation runs on a `std::thread`, communicates back over an `mpsc` channel,
//! and calls `ctx.request_repaint()` so the UI wakes to drain it. The Settings
//! "Updates" pane renders [`UpdateState`]; the on-launch (Auto) path drives a
//! yes/no modal.
//!
//! Privacy: the ONLY network the updater performs is a single HTTPS GET to the
//! public GitHub Releases API (plus the asset/sig/sha downloads when the user
//! chooses to install). No identifiers, no analytics — see PRIVACY.md.
