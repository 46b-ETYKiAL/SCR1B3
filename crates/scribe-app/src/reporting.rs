//! W1TN3SS opt-in crash/error reporting — the SCR1B3 host glue.
//!
//! This module is thin host glue over the in-house `itasha-report-core` SDK
//! (pinned git tag). SCR1B3 implements NO SDK behavior — the config model,
//! sanitizer, spool, transport, preview API and consent gate all live in the
//! SDK and are CALLED here. The two seams this module owns are:
//!
//! 1. **Capture** ([`capture_panic`]) — the panic hook builds a Tier-1 report
//!    from the panic's `&'static str` message + our own `file:line` SITE,
//!    sanitizes it, and SPOOLS it locally. It transmits NOTHING — local-first,
//!    offline-safe, consent comes later.
//! 2. **Consent-gated send** ([`send_report`]) — given a host-minted
//!    [`ConsentToken`] (which only exists after the user agreed in the consent
//!    dialog, or because the stream's mode is `Always`), transmit one spooled
//!    report through the SDK's hardened transport, then log the outcome.
//!
//! Privacy invariants (inherited from the SDK, asserted at this surface):
//! - default-OFF (both streams default [`ReportingMode::Off`]),
//! - consent-gated (no [`ConsentToken`] => no send — enforced at the type level
//!   by the SDK's `IngestBackend::send` signature),
//! - previewable+editable before send (the dialog calls [`preview_text`]),
//! - no persistent identifier (only the consent token's ephemeral nonce),
//! - the panic `&'static str` discipline (a `String` payload — which could embed
//!   buffer text or a path — is deliberately suppressed at capture).
