//! Per-frame find cache for the in-buffer find bar (P-01 / 4-02 R2).
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! While the find bar is open, the editor render path calls
//! `scribe_core::search::find_all(&text, &query)` on the active buffer **every
//! frame** — from the find-bar counter (`{i}/{n}`), the highlight-all overlay,
//! and navigation. That is a full-document rescan AND a fresh regex compile per
//! frame, even when neither the query nor the document changed since the last
//! frame. On a large buffer that pegs a core for nothing.
//!
//! # Fix
//!
//! Memoize the match list keyed by `(query, flags, edit_gen, doc_id)` — the SAME
//! generation-keyed idiom the spell-check and change-bar caches already use
//! (`edit_gen` is bumped on every edit; `doc_id` disambiguates tabs that happen
//! to share an `edit_gen` in the single-slot cache). The matches are recomputed
//! ONLY when the cache key moves; on an idle frame the cached `Vec<Match>` is
//! cloned out, so `find_all` is never re-invoked.
//!
//! The recompute *decision* is factored into [`FindCacheKey`] +
//! [`should_recompute`] so it is a pure, side-effect-free predicate the unit
//! tests can drive without standing up an egui frame.
