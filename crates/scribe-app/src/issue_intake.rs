//! W1TN3SS manual "Report an issue" intake — the SCR1B3 host glue.
//!
//! This is the user-initiated counterpart to [`crate::reporting`] (the opt-in
//! CRASH path). It owns NO transport: it builds a prefilled GitHub **Issue-Form
//! deep link** and hands it to the user's browser, or — when the URL would
//! exceed the helper's `GITHUB_URL_LENGTH_THRESHOLD` (the HTTP-414 ceiling, the
//! VS Code clipboard-fallback pattern) — copies the body to the clipboard, or
//! offers a `mailto:` fallback to a config-injected support alias. All of the
//! URL / clipboard-body / mailto building is DELEGATED to
//! `itasha_report_core::intake` (the consumed seam, pinned by git tag); this
//! module only wires the dialog UX state and the launch decision.
//!
//! Privacy invariants (asserted by the tests in this module):
//! - **User-initiated only.** Nothing happens until the user opens the dialog
//!   (a command-palette entry) and presses Open / Copy / Email. There is no
//!   background or default-on path.
//! - **Previewable + editable.** The prefilled body is shown in an editable
//!   field BEFORE any browser / mail client opens; the user sees and can edit
//!   the exact text that leaves.
//! - **Diagnostics OFF by default.** No app version / OS / renderer line is
//!   included unless the user explicitly ticks the diagnostics toggle. Even then
//!   the values are host-provided, non-identifying, and visible in the preview.
//! - **No persistent identifier.** No install-id / fingerprint / session-id is
//!   ever built into the title, body, query string, or mailto. A test asserts
//!   no stable-ID field appears in any built URL / body.
