//! Isolated Win32 window-chrome fixups.
//!
//! This is the ONLY crate in the SCR1B3 tree permitted `unsafe` — mirroring
//! scribe-core's single mmap exception. It quarantines the audited Win32 FFI
//! that removes the "doubled caption buttons" the OS draws over our custom
//! titlebar on a frameless + transparent window.
//!
//! ## Root cause (deep-researched, primary-sourced)
//!
//! winit leaves `WS_SYSMENU | WS_MINIMIZEBOX | WS_MAXIMIZEBOX` set on an
//! UNDECORATED top-level window — it strips only `WS_CAPTION`/`WS_SIZEBOX`
//! (winit #2754). On Win11 DWM draws the native min/max/close caption buttons
//! GATED ON THOSE STYLE BITS. winit's transparency is `DwmEnableBlurBehindWindow`
//! (a DWM-COMPOSITED frame), so it does not CREATE the buttons — it UNMASKS the
//! DWM-drawn buttons the opaque panel was hiding ("doubled buttons with
//! transparency on"; opaque pixels hid them before).
//!
//! ## Why the earlier `WM_NCCALCSIZE` fix could never work
//!
//! Returning 0 from `WM_NCCALCSIZE` removes the STANDARD non-client frame, but
//! Microsoft documents that it "does not affect frames that are extended into
//! the client area" / DWM-composited content. The caption buttons are
//! DWM-composited, so `WM_NCCALCSIZE` is STRUCTURALLY incapable of removing
//! them. (`DWMWA_NCRENDERING_POLICY = DWMNCRP_DISABLED` is also wrong — it fights
//! winit's `DwmEnableBlurBehindWindow` transparency.)
//!
//! ## The fix (canonical: melak47/BorderlessWindow, MS DWM sample, Tao/Tauri,
//! Electron)
//!
//! CLEAR the caption-button style bits with `SetWindowLongPtrW(GWL_STYLE, …)` +
//! `SetWindowPos(SWP_FRAMECHANGED)` — see [`imp::CAPTION_BUTTON_STYLES`]. With
//! the bits gone, DWM draws no native buttons, in opaque OR transparent mode,
//! and winit's transparency is left untouched. The strip is re-applied every
//! frame because winit re-derives styles from its `WindowFlags` on some
//! resize/restore paths (cheap: it only writes when a bit is actually present).
//!
//! The `WM_NCCALCSIZE` subclass is RETAINED, but ONLY for its other job: clamping
//! a borderless MAXIMIZE to the monitor work area (and an auto-hide taskbar) so
//! it doesn't cover the taskbar. Resize and drag are egui-owned
//! (`ViewportCommand::BeginResize` — winit #4186 — and `StartDrag`), so the NC
//! area is otherwise unused.
//!
//! Trade-off of clearing `WS_SYSMENU`: Alt+Space and the taskbar right-click
//! system menu go away; the custom titlebar already provides min/max/close.
//! [`set_snap_support_enabled`] is the opt-in that trades that default back the
//! other way (see below).
//!
//! ## Extensions: Snap Layouts, system menu, rounded corners, backdrop
//!
//! Everything above is unchanged. Layered on top:
//!
//! * **`WM_NCHITTEST`** — the subclass now answers it, returning `HTMAXBUTTON`
//!   over the app-published maximize-button rect ([`set_maximize_button_rect`]).
//!   That reply is the ONLY trigger for the Windows 11 **Snap Layouts** flyout.
//!   `DwmDefWindowProc` is consulted FIRST for the caption-button message set,
//!   per the MS custom-frame guidance, so DWM renders the flyout itself.
//! * **Drag/resize ownership** — deliberately left with egui
//!   ([`hit_test::HitTestMode::MaximizeButtonOnly`], the default): every point
//!   except the maximize button answers `HTCLIENT`, so
//!   `scribe-app/src/app/chrome.rs`'s `resize_dir_at` / `handle_frameless_resize`
//!   and `ViewportCommand::StartDrag` keep working untouched. Two systems both
//!   answering "is this a resize edge?" is a real bug source (the OS modal resize
//!   loop eats the button-up egui's state machine waits for), so exactly one owns
//!   it. [`hit_test::HitTestMode::FullNonClient`] is available for ports that
//!   want the opposite split — an app selecting it MUST disable its egui-space
//!   resize handler.
//! * **`HTMAXBUTTON` consequence** — Windows then routes clicks over that rect as
//!   `WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN`/`UP`, so egui never sees them. The subclass handles those
//!   itself and posts `WM_SYSCOMMAND(SC_MAXIMIZE|SC_RESTORE)`, and tracks hover
//!   for [`maximize_button_hovered`] so the app can still paint its hover state.
//! * **System menu** — [`show_system_menu`] pops the real `GetSystemMenu` popup
//!   with correct per-state greying ([`system_menu::menu_state`]).
//! * **Rounded corners** — `DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE = DWMWCP_ROUND`,
//!   applied once from [`ensure_caption_stripped`]. Windows 10 rejects the
//!   attribute with an `HRESULT` we ignore, so it degrades to today's square
//!   window; it can never fail the app.
//! * **Backdrop (Mica/Acrylic)** — [`set_backdrop`], DEFAULT-OFF. See its doc for
//!   why it is opt-in rather than on.
