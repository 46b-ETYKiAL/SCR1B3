"""Reject commits whose author/committer identity is not an allowlisted one.

Commit metadata is exactly as public as the tree, and it is the vector that
actually leaks: a mailbox committed into `%ae`/`%ce` is published the moment
the branch is pushed, and it cannot be redacted afterwards without rewriting
history. A tree-content audit cannot see it at all.

Four design decisions are load-bearing - read them before editing:

1.  **Allowlist by SHAPE, never a denylist of addresses.** Listing the
    mailboxes we want to keep out would write those exact mailboxes into a
    public file - the guard would publish the very PII it exists to suppress.
    The rule is inverted instead: an identity must MATCH a permitted shape
    (a forge `noreply` address, or an explicitly configured domain) and
    everything else is a violation, whatever it happens to be. A new leak
    class therefore needs no new pattern; it is rejected by default.

2.  **Range-scoped, not history-wide.** The default range is the push or PR
    range. Historical commits already carry mailboxes that only a history
    rewrite - an owner decision - can clear, and a gate that is permanently
    red for something no ordinary PR can fix is a gate people learn to ignore.
    Pass `--all` to audit the whole history as a reporting run.

3.  **An unresolvable range fails CLOSED.** A base that cannot be resolved
    (a force-push, a shallow clone, a first push of a new branch) falls back
    to a bounded walk of the head commit's recent ancestry rather than
    silently checking nothing. An empty range is reported as such, and
    `--require-nonempty` turns "I checked zero commits" into a failure - the
    difference between a guard that passed and a guard that never ran.

4.  **Both identities, every commit.** `git commit --amend --author=...`
    changes `%ae` alone; a rebase changes `%ce` alone. Checking one of the two
    leaves the other wide open, so both are checked on every commit.

A contributor's NAME is deliberately unconstrained. Names are public
attribution and are welcome, in commits and in the contributor list. It is
only the mailbox that must stay out - with one exception, which is why the
name fields are read at all: a name field that carries a WORKSTATION ACCOUNT
NAME, a home path, or an internal token is not attribution, it is the same
leak the content-safety audit exists to catch, wearing a different field.
`git` fills `user.name` from the OS account by default, so this is the
accidental case, not the adversarial one - and by volume it is the LARGER
exposure here: on this repository 549 commits carry the account name in a name
field against 30 carrying a personal mailbox in an address field, and the
address rules cannot see any of the 549. The name is therefore passed through
the content-safety audit's scanner: whatever that scanner already refuses is
refused here too, and every other name is accepted untouched.
