"""Falsification suite for the public-repo content-safety audit.

Every leak class the audit claims to detect is fed to it here and asserted to
be CAUGHT, and every legitimate construct that a naive version of the same rule
would flag is asserted to stay CLEAN. A guard with no negative cases is a guard
nobody can safely tighten.

IMPORTANT - why every sample is assembled from fragments:
    This file is a tracked file, so the audit scans it like any other. A sample
    written as one literal would be a real leak sitting in the repository. Each
    sample is therefore split across a concatenation so that no leak-shaped
    string exists in the file's own bytes, while the value handed to the
    scanner at runtime is exactly the leak we mean to test. Keep this property
    when adding cases: assemble, never inline.

Run:  python scripts/test_content_safety_audit.py
      (or: python -m pytest scripts/test_content_safety_audit.py)
