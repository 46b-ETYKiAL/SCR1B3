"""Falsification suite for the commit author/committer identity guard.

Every identity class the guard claims to reject is fed to it here and asserted
to be REJECTED, and every identity that must keep working is asserted to be
ACCEPTED. A guard with no negative cases is a guard nobody can safely tighten,
and an allowlist with no rejection cases is indistinguishable from one that
accepts everything.

IMPORTANT - why the rejected samples are assembled from fragments:
    This file is a tracked file and the content-safety audit scans it like any
    other. A real-looking mailbox written as one literal would be an actual
    leak sitting in the repository - the guard would be publishing the very
    PII it exists to suppress. Each sample is therefore split across a
    concatenation so no mailbox-shaped string exists in this file's own bytes,
    while the value handed to the guard at runtime is exactly the identity we
    mean to test. Keep this property when adding cases: assemble, never inline.

    The domains used below are ordinary consumer-mail domains chosen because
    they are NOT reserved: a reserved domain (example.com) would be exempt
    under the content-safety audit's documentation-domain rule, and the case
    would then pass for the wrong reason.
