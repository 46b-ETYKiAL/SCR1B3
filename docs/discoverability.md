## Social preview image

Upload `.github/assets/social-preview.svg` (rasterize to 1280×640 PNG via any
SVG→PNG tool) under Settings → Social preview. This is the card shown when the
repo is shared.

## README hero

`README.md` embeds `.github/assets/header.svg` as the hero image (and
`.github/assets/footer.svg` at the foot) and links the per-OS install
one-liners high above the fold.

## Release artifacts

Tag-driven releases (`v*`) attach per-OS binaries + installers, each with its
own `<asset>.minisig` signature, plus one signed `SHA256SUMS` +
`SHA256SUMS.minisig` covering the whole release, so the "Releases" page and
`packaging/install.sh` resolve and verify the latest build automatically.

## Recommended GitHub settings

- Enable **Issues** and **Discussions**.
- Add the description + topics above.
- Pin a "Getting started" discussion linking the install section.
- Add `good first issue` / `help wanted` labels for contributors.
