# Security Policy

SCR1B3 is built privacy-first and minimal-attack-surface by construction. This document describes that posture and how to report vulnerabilities. A per-trust-boundary STRIDE analysis (auto-update / plugins / LSP / opened files / local state) lives in [`docs/threat-model.md`](docs/threat-model.md).

## Telemetry-free posture

SCR1B3 collects **nothing** about you and transmits **no** file contents, ever.

- **No account, no login, no cloud.** The editor works fully offline.
- **No analytics, no usage counters, no crash beacons.** There is no phone-home.
- **File contents never leave your device.** Editing, search, syntax highlighting, and spellcheck are entirely local.
- **Logs to stderr only.** Structured logs are emitted to stderr (never a file, never transmitted); verbosity defaults to `warn` and is controlled by `RUST_LOG`.

### The two network surfaces

SCR1B3 has exactly **two** outbound network surfaces. The first runs by default; the second is opt-in and default-OFF. Both are under your explicit control and the full transparency record is in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

**1. The update version-check (default `notify`).** It:

- Contacts **only** the public GitHub Releases API.
- Sends **zero PII** — it is an unauthenticated request that asks "what is the latest release?" and nothing else. No identifiers, no telemetry, no shipped token.
- Is **fully user-controllable** via `[updates] mode` in your config: `off`, `notify` (default — a single startup version-check), `manual`, or `auto`. Set it to `off` to disable the check. (See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md).)

**2. Opt-in W1TN3SS crash/error reporting (default OFF).** A per-stream, consent-gated crash/error + manual-issue reporting stream that transmits **nothing** unless you turn it on **and** consent to a specific report. It is off by default, local-first (spooled on your machine), previewable, and sends no persistent identifier. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) § Opt-in crash / error reporting for the full posture. With `[updates] mode = "off"` and reporting left off (the default), SCR1B3 makes zero outbound connections.

## Signed-update verification

When an update is downloaded, SCR1B3 **cryptographically verifies it before applying it**:

- Release artifacts are signed (minisign / ed25519) and checksummed.
- The updater **refuses** any download whose signature does not verify against the embedded trust set, or whose checksum does not match. An unsigned or tampered artifact is never installed.
- **Key-rotation-safe trust set.** Verification accepts a release signed by **any** key in an embedded set of trusted keys, so the signing key can be rotated with **zero downtime**: ship a build that trusts both the old and new keys, switch CI to sign with the new key, then retire the old key in a later release — no client is ever stranded. Trying multiple keys never upgrades a bad signature into an accepted one (a full cryptographic verify is still required).
- **Anti-downgrade (rollback-attack defense).** The updater refuses to install any version that is not **strictly newer** than the running build — enforced again at the moment of applying, not only at selection — so an attacker cannot replay an older, still-validly-signed release to force a downgrade to a known-vulnerable build (the TUF monotonic-version rule).
- **Automatic rollback.** The previous binary is snapshotted before the in-place swap and is automatically restored if the updated binary fails to relaunch — a failed update never leaves you without a working app.
- **One click, then auto-cleanup.** Choosing **Update now** downloads and installs in a single action (no separate "install" step). Once the update is applied, the downloaded archive/installer and its `.minisig`/`.sha256` sidecars are deleted, and the one kept-prior backup is removed at the next launch (once the new build has confirmed it runs) — no stale downloads are left behind.
- **Least-privilege install, explicit elevation.** For a per-user / portable install the updater swaps the binary in place with **your own user permissions** — no elevation. For an install in a protected location (e.g. `C:\Program Files`), it runs the **verified, signed** self-elevating installer, which requests administrator rights via the standard Windows **UAC** prompt. It never silently elevates and never uses setuid; the same minisign + checksum gate applies to the installer as to the archive.

To verify a release manually, use the published `minisign` public key against the release's signature file (instructions accompany each release).

## Plugin trust + sandbox model

The user plugin/mod system is opt-in and sandboxed (see [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md)):

- **A plugin only runs after you approve it.** Dropping a folder into the plugins dir does **not** auto-execute it. By default the editor uses **trust-on-first-use**: it records the SHA-256 of the *exact* entry script you approved (in `[plugins] trusted`) and refuses to run a brand-new **or silently modified** script until you approve it again (Settings → Plugins → Manage plugins → **Approve & run**). A held-back plugin is shown as "not running — needs your approval".
- **Strict signed mode.** Set `[plugins] require_signed = true` and a plugin runs only when it carries a valid **minisign** signature over its entry script from a **pinned author key** (TOFU key-pinning; a changed key is refused). This authenticates the *code that runs*, not just metadata, via the same `update::verify` cryptographic surface as the auto-updater.
- **Sandbox.** The scripting "easy mode" runs in a restricted Rhai engine with seven caps wired (operations, call depth, string size, array size, map size, modules, expression depth) plus a wall-clock deadline. Both the `eval` and `import` keywords are removed from the parser and the module resolver is a no-op — a script using them fails to **compile**, never just at runtime. (A compiled-WASM power track is a documented future design — `PluginKind::Wasm` is reserved but no WASM runtime ships in v1; only the Rhai easy-mode is executable today.)
- **Capability surface.** The v1 host exposes only buffer-text operations to scripts — there is **no** ambient filesystem, network, or process access for a script to reach, so a plugin cannot silently exfiltrate files or open the network. Privileged host capabilities (and the per-capability consent prompt the manifest models) are not yet exposed; any future privileged capability will be gated behind explicit consent before it ships.
- You can disable any plugin via `[plugins] disabled` or turn the whole system off with `[plugins] enabled = false`.

## Configuration is data, not code

The config and theme files are **TOML** — a data format with no code-execution surface. Malformed config or themes fall back to safe defaults with a surfaced error; they cannot run arbitrary code.

## Language-server (LSP) spawn discipline

Optional language servers run as **child processes** under your user identity, never under a shell:

- The server binary path is taken directly from your config (a single executable name or absolute path).
- Arguments pass to the child via `std::process::Command::args(&[...])` — one Rust array, not a shell string. Argv is delivered to the child unmodified.
- The declared MSRV is `rust-version = "1.92"` in `Cargo.toml` (the floor the egui stack imposes; enforced by the `msrv` CI job), and every published binary is built with the pinned **`1.95.0`** release toolchain. Both are well above the **1.77.2** floor that mitigates [CVE-2024-24576 ("BatBadBut")](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24576) — the bug where Windows `.bat` / `.cmd` arguments could be reinterpreted by `cmd.exe`'s tokeniser. Newer rustc escapes them safely, so for any conforming build (≥ MSRV) and for every shipped release that escaping is unconditional.
- The child's stdin / stdout are wired as pipes; stderr is **dropped** so a chatty language server cannot pollute the editor's own log channel.
- A missing or unspawnable server **degrades gracefully** to "no LSP for this language" rather than aborting — the editor is the trust boundary, not the language server.

## Plugin tarball verification (manifest + author-key pinning)

When a plugin ships via the registry (or via a signed URL install), the tarball is verified before any code runs:

1. **SHA-256 checksum** declared in the manifest is recomputed from the on-the-wire bytes. Mismatch → `"Plugin file is corrupted or has been modified since publication."` and the install aborts.
2. **minisign signature** is verified against the manifest-declared `author_pubkey`. The verification path is the **same** `update::verify` code that gates SCR1B3's auto-updater — one cryptographic surface, not two.
3. **Trust-on-first-use (TOFU) author-key pinning.** The first install records the manifest's `author_pubkey` in `<config_dir>/plugins/pinned-keys.toml`. Subsequent installs / updates of the **same plugin id** must present a byte-identical key. A different key triggers a **"Author key changed — accept new key?"** modal; silent rotation is refused. Same discipline as SSH `known_hosts` and OpenBSD `signify`.

The signed unit is the **whole gzipped tarball** — no metadata extraction, no canonicalisation, no reproducibility wizardry. The verifier rebuilds the bytes from the file on disk and either accepts or rejects.

## Unsafe-code discipline

Each crate declares its `unsafe` posture:

- **`scribe-render`** — `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Pure-safe Rust: theme → egui `Visuals` mapping, color math, CRT parameter conversion. Forbid is unconditional; no local override is reachable.
- **`scribe-app`** — `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The egui/eframe shell never needs `unsafe`.
- **`scribe-core`** — `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with a single documented exception in `document.rs` for the read-only `memmap2::Mmap::map` on the multi-GB-open path. The exception carries an explicit `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` annotation and a `SAFETY:` comment naming the invariants (read-only handle; dropped before any edit).
- **`scribe-win32-chrome`** — the quarantined Win32 FFI crate for the frameless titlebar; it is unsafe by design (no forbid/deny attribute) and is the single crate where `unsafe` blocks live outside scribe-core's mmap exception. Each block carries a `SAFETY:` rationale.

`forbid` is preferred where it is reachable because it **cannot be locally overridden** — a new `unsafe` block cannot land via `#[allow]`. `deny` is used only where a documented exception exists; the `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` is then visible per call-site so the unsafe budget is explicit, not implicit.

## Binary hardening (Windows)

The release binary is built with **Control Flow Guard** (`/guard:cf`) via
[`.cargo/config.toml`](.cargo/config.toml) (`-C control-flow-guard` under the
`cfg(windows)` target). CFG hardens indirect calls and returns against
ROP/JOP control-flow-hijack chains — the residual exploit class that
memory-safety does not, on its own, fully close in the presence of `unsafe` in
transitive GPU/windowing dependencies (`wgpu`, `winit`). It carries ~0.1% size
and ~3% runtime overhead and has been stable since Rust 1.47.

ASLR (`/DYNAMICBASE`), DEP (`/NXCOMPAT`) and High-Entropy VA are already MSVC
linker defaults for 64-bit Rust executables; CFG is the high-value mitigation
that is *not* on by default, so it is opted in for every Windows build.

**The mitigations are CI-verified, so they cannot silently regress.** The
`binary hardening (winchecksec)` CI job builds the release binary and runs
[winchecksec](https://github.com/trailofbits/winchecksec) (SHA-256-pinned
download) over it, failing the build unless the shipped exe actually carries
**CFG + ASLR (`/DYNAMICBASE`) + High-Entropy VA + DEP (`/NXCOMPAT`)**. A change
that ever dropped a mitigation fails here instead of shipping a weaker binary.

The release binary is also built with `--remap-path-prefix`, stripping the
build-machine absolute paths (workspace + cargo home) from the artifact for
cleaner, more deterministic output.

## Supply chain

- All dependencies are pinned via `Cargo.lock`.
- `cargo-audit` (advisory database) and `cargo-deny` (license + advisory policy) gate the build in CI, and `cargo-vet` (supply-chain dependency review) runs as a dedicated `supply-chain-audit` job.
- **The telemetry-free posture is enforced at the dependency-graph level.** [`deny.toml`](deny.toml) `[bans]` denies every alternative HTTP client / async runtime (`reqwest`, `hyper`, `isahc`, `curl`, `surf`, `tokio`) and every analytics / crash-reporting crate (`sentry`, `opentelemetry`, `posthog-rs`, `mixpanel`, …). The *only* sanctioned network stack is the synchronous, runtime-free `ureq` + `rustls` used by the opt-out update check; the `cargo-deny bans` gate (a required status check) fails the build if a second egress path or any telemetry crate ever enters the tree.
- **An unused dependency fails CI.** `cargo-machete` runs in CI and blocks any dependency that is declared but unused — keeping the dependency graph (and the attack surface) minimal.
- A CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM is produced at release, **and the shipped binary embeds its own scannable SBOM** via `cargo-auditable`: the exact released artifact can be vuln-scanned offline with `cargo audit bin scr1b3.exe`, trivy, grype, or osv-scanner — not just a detached side-file.
- **SLSA build-provenance.** Every release artifact carries a signed [build-provenance attestation](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations) (GitHub OIDC + Sigstore), verifiable with `gh attestation verify <file> --repo <repo>`. This is *additive* to the minisign signatures: minisign attests **author** identity (the embedded key); provenance attests **build** integrity (which workflow, commit, and runner produced the artifact).
- Dependency names are checked against slopsquatting before any addition.

## Continuous security gates

These workflows run on every push and pull request against the public repository (and on a nightly cron for the supply-chain checks so an advisory that lands between PRs is caught within 24 hours):

| Gate | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Supply-chain policy | [`workflows/cargo-deny.yml`](.github/workflows/cargo-deny.yml) | `cargo-deny` matrix-runs **advisories / bans / licenses / sources** against the workspace `deny.toml`. Nightly cron @ 06:30 UTC. |
| Secret scan | [`workflows/secret-scan.yml`](.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml) | `gitleaks` scans full history for committed API keys / tokens / minisign private-key material. |
| SBOM | [`workflows/sbom.yml`](.github/workflows/sbom.yml) | `cargo-cyclonedx` emits a CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM and attaches it to every tagged release as `scr1b3-sbom.cdx.json`. |
| Content-safety | [`scripts/content_safety_audit.py`](scripts/content_safety_audit.py) | The publishable-cleanliness gate — fails any change that introduces an internal path, agent-system reference, or secret-shaped string into the public-repo-bound tree. |
| Dependency bumps | [`dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml) | Weekly Cargo + GitHub-Actions update PRs (Monday 09:00 UTC, 5 PRs cap). |
| Workflow security (zizmor) | [`workflows/workflow-security.yml`](.github/workflows/workflow-security.yml) | `zizmor` static analysis for template injection, dangerous triggers, unpinned actions, and excessive permissions. SARIF results land in the Security tab. Weekly cron @ Thursday 06:47 UTC. |
| CodeQL | [`workflows/codeql.yml`](.github/workflows/codeql.yml) | CodeQL with `security-extended` queries on Python (`scripts/*.py`) and GitHub Actions. Rust is not a CodeQL-supported free public-repo language — it is covered by `cargo clippy --deny warnings` and `cargo-deny`. Weekly cron @ Tuesday 14:23 UTC. |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | [`workflows/scorecard.yml`](.github/workflows/scorecard.yml) | OpenSSF Scorecard supply-chain assessment with public publication of the score. Weekly cron @ Wednesday 09:31 UTC. |

## CI/CD security posture

This section documents the load-bearing CI/CD controls on the `master` branch of this public repository. It is a baseline — the controls below are the defaults the maintainer commits to; any drift should be reconciled, not normalised.

### Branch protection contract

`master` carries a GitHub branch-protection rule with the following guarantees:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `required_status_checks` | `build & test (ubuntu-latest)`, `build & test (windows-latest)`, `build & test (macos-latest)`, `cargo-deny advisories`, `cargo-deny bans`, `cargo-deny licenses`, `cargo-deny sources`, `public-repo content-safety audit`, `F0RG3-W1R3 install-manifest audit`, `gitleaks`, `zizmor workflow audit`, `Analyze (python)`, `Analyze (actions)`, `Scorecard analysis` | A PR cannot merge unless every gate that already exists passes. The gates are advisory if they aren't required; advisory is honour-system. |
| `required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count` | `1` | Forces every change through PR review, even from the maintainer. |
| `required_pull_request_reviews.dismiss_stale_reviews` | `true` | A new push invalidates a stale approval. |
| `required_pull_request_reviews.bypass_pull_request_allowances` | configured | A narrow emergency self-merge path exists so a hotfix is not blocked when no second reviewer is available. Any such merge is recorded by GitHub in the repository audit log. |
| `required_conversation_resolution` | `true` | Every PR comment thread must be resolved before merge. |
| `required_linear_history` | `true` | No merge commits — rebase or squash only. |
| `required_signatures` | `true` | Every commit landing on `master` must be signature-verified. |
| `allow_force_pushes` | `false` | History on `master` is immutable. |
| `allow_deletions` | `false` | `master` cannot be deleted. |
| `enforce_admins` | `false` | An emergency path is deliberately preserved for the case where the gates themselves are broken. Every merge that uses it is recorded in the repository audit log and is reviewable after the fact. |

### Dependabot security updates

Dependabot is configured at [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml) for both the Cargo ecosystem (workspace + crate manifests under `crates/`) and the `github-actions` ecosystem (the workflows under `.github/workflows/`). Updates land as PRs every Monday 09:00 UTC with a cap of 5 open PRs per ecosystem.

Dependabot security updates (the auto-PR on a newly-disclosed advisory) is the higher-priority surface — when enabled at the repo settings layer, an advisory landing on a transitive dependency opens a PR within minutes rather than waiting for the weekly tick.

### SHA-pinned GitHub Actions

Every `uses: <action>@<tag>` reference in `.github/workflows/*.yml` is pinned by full 40-char commit SHA with a trailing version comment, e.g.:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
- uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@ff98106e4c7b2bc287b24eaf42907196329070c7 # v2.3.9
```

This closes the tag-mover supply-chain class documented in the March-2025 `tj-actions/changed-files` incident: a JS Action runs in-process on the runner with full secret context, so a malicious tag-move on a popular action repo would let it exfiltrate every secret in the workflow scope on its next run. SHA-pinning makes the action a content-addressed dependency rather than a mutable reference.

Dependabot rewrites both the SHA pin and the trailing version comment together — the version comment never drifts from the pinned SHA, because the same Dependabot PR updates both lines.

The companion control is `persist-credentials: false` on every `actions/checkout@…` step. Without it, the runner leaves `GITHUB_TOKEN` material in `.git/config` for downstream steps to read — SHA-pinning the checkout alone is insufficient.

### Weekly security-scan schedule

The three workflow-security feeds are staggered across the week to spread runner usage:

| Workflow | Cron | Slot |
|---|---|---|
| CodeQL | `23 14 * * 2` | Tuesday 14:23 UTC |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | `31 9 * * 3` | Wednesday 09:31 UTC |
| Workflow Security (zizmor) | `47 6 * * 4` | Thursday 06:47 UTC |

Each also runs on every push to `master` and every PR, so the weekly cron is the catch-up surface for advisories or upstream rule additions that landed between PRs.

### Gitleaks: PR-time and push-protection

`gitleaks` runs on every PR and every push to `master` via the [`workflows/secret-scan.yml`](.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml) workflow. Full history is scanned (`fetch-depth: 0`), and the action exits non-zero on any finding — a PR carrying a leak cannot merge.

The complementary control is GitHub-native **secret scanning + push protection**, enabled at the repo settings layer. This blocks a `git push` at the server before the commit lands, so even a leaked secret in a *local* commit never reaches the public history.

The two controls compose: push protection catches the leak at `git push` time; gitleaks catches anything that slips through (e.g. a credential committed before the secret scanner learned its pattern, surfaced via the full-history scan).

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately using GitHub's **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)** (the "Report a vulnerability" button under the repository's Security tab). Include:

- A description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal proof of concept if possible).
- Affected version(s) and OS.

We aim to acknowledge reports promptly, keep you updated on remediation, and credit reporters who wish to be named once a fix ships. Please allow reasonable time for a fix before any public disclosure.

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the latest released version. Update via your package manager or the auto-update mechanism to stay current.
